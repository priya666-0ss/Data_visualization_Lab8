I Created the following graphics for Iris data available in UCI repository or default repository of R.

Histograms of all the properties                                                      
Scatter plot of data points with each species in different color                                               
Violin or Box plot for separate species in a single plot                                             


In this graphics I added the following interactivity:

1.User can change the bin size of all the histogram separately                                                             
2.User can change colors of each histogram separately                                                                         
3.User can choose the x-axis and y-axis for the scatter plot                                                       
4.User can change colors of different species in scatter plot                                                             
5.User can filter only certain species for the scatter plot                                              
6.User can change the point size and shape for different species in the scatter plot                                                   


In order to run, dowload the repository. iris.csv need to be in same folder as code.R.                                              
Then just run that R file. Outputs will come on a browser window.
